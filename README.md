# Credit-Card-Fraud
Credit Card Fraud Detection, transformers with an attention mechanism approach

The goal is to build a transformer based model to detect the fraudulent transactions made by credit cards by the use of machine learning techniques, to stop fraudsters from the unauthorized usage of customersâ€™ accounts.

### Understanding Credit Card Fraud
- A credit card is one of the most used financial products to make online purchases and payments
- Fraudsters deceivingly use a variety of scams to illicitly obtain card information or open new accounts in victims' names. 

### Types of Credit Card Fraud:
- Card-present fraud 
- Card-not-present fraud
- Lost/Stolen Cards
- Card Abuse
- Identity Theft
- Merchant Abuse
- Skimming
- Phishing

### Conclusion:
After an extensive comparative analysis from ratios 1:10 - 1:10 with a variations of samples sizes, we found that KNN has better accuracy than all the other algorithms with an overall 0.9965 accuracy from a 1:10 Ratio with 3500 fraud transactions

The Fraud-model with LSTM GRU layers was the closest to KNN model.

Overall, analysis thru several experiments from several different sizes of sub samples that the accuracies and other metrics (F1, Recall, Precision) did not change drastically but rather stayed constant.
